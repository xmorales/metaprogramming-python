## What is an object in Python?
- string
- A function
- A class definition
- An instance of a class
- Everything

## What is a Class in Python?
- Object that creates a new object, or instance
- Contains functions and attributes
- Can create an instance
- Who creates a class?
  - See the workshop


## Hierarchy of classes
- A class can inherit another
  - Can use all attributes and functions of the base/super class
  - In python any Class is always a derived class, at least of the superclass 'object'
    - See the workshop
- Multiple inheritance is possible
  - the search for attributes inherited from a parent class goes depth-first, left-to-right, not searching twice
